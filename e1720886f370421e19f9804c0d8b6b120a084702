Simple example is, if somebody want to change the statistics time interval run time, that\u0027s something plugin can definitely implement, and reconnecting all the devices for that is too much of a ask. There is very much possible scenario where user wants to do it.\n\nWhen anybody changes openflowplugin.cfg, it can call the update method in the plugin and that update method can call these setter method, so yes, these methods can be used as a notification to any service that is using it.",

We don\u0027t want to implement an approach now, that we will have to change again in future because it doesn\u0027t provide notification. Can you please add a listener to the existing config interface you created, so that these intereface will be available for users to consume whenever they need this functionality.",

      "message": "That is true, but then if we will need it we can extend current implementation to include something like listeners for configuration changes. And setters, at least from my understanding, should not contain any logic other than actually updating the variable to what is setter associated, so strictly following this standard, we should not propagate change what happened in setter in manager to all underlying contexts (what we would need to do there if we would want to update configurations related to contexts without requiring context reload, so reconnect of device). And currently, statistics polling interval if I am not wrong is managed in manager, and not in contexts, so with this change, every time next statistics is polled, we would have updated configuration of poll interval, so next poll will be scheduled with this new delay.",
