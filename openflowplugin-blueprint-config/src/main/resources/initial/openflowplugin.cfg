# When true, openflowplugin won't send any specific role
# request down to the switch after plugin internally decides the
# ownership of the device using Entity Ownership Service. In this
# scenario, controller connection for the device will be in equal
# role. The behavior will be same for single node setup and clustered
# setup. In clustered scenario, all the controller will be in equal
# role for the device. In this case device will send all asynchronous
# event messages (e.g packet_in) to all the controllers, but openflowplugin
# will drop these events for the controller instances that is internally
# not owning the device.

# When true, Yang models are serialized and deserialized directly to and from
