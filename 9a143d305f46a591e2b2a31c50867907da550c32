      "message": "looks like deactivateTransactionManager() and onTransactionChainFailed() can cause race condition here, given that onTransactionChainFailed and future callback in deactivateTransactionManager will be called in separate thread. so there is a possibility that onTransactionChainFailed  may end up creating a new transaction chain, which won\u0027t be used by anyone, given that device is disconnected (or moved to slave)",

      "message": "More o less the logic here is the same as before. After transaction failed event we recreate a new tChain. The only stuff here is that method will check if the txChain in failed event is still the same txChain we created. If not ignoring txChain was recreated somewhere else. If it is the same it will be recreated here. So long we keep it synchronized and even if there was deactivate call before the method do practically nothing because the chain is already null or changed.",
