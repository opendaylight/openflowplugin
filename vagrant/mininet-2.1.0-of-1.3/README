This directory will allow you to materialize a Virtual Box VM using
vagrant that has mininet-2.1.0, OVS-2.0, and patched to make
it easy to use OpenFlow 1.3 with mininet.

To use it:

1)  Install Virtaul Box:
https://www.virtualbox.org/
2)  Install Vagrant:
http://www.vagrantup.com/
3)  In this directory, run at the command line

vagrant up

This will build and configure the VM and run
it.

4)  In this directory, run at the command line

vagrant ssh

(This will ssh to the VM you just ran)

5)  You can then run mininet for OF 1.3 using

sudo mn --topo single,3  --controller 'remote,ip=<your controller IP>' --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13


Many thanks to Fred Hsu who turned me onto Vagrant:

Many thanks to Michal Rehak who did the original underlying work to
figure out how to get mininet working with OF 1.3 and is the original
source of the mininet patch:
