Looking at the implementation, it seems to return false in case of internal errors?  This looks like questionable exception handling to me.  I won\u0027t -1 it again though, and just abstain from voting, as you have added the JavaDoc and addressed my initial point, so I don\u0027t want to stand in the way if OFP commiters are OK to merge this.",
