      "message": "The method was renamed to indicate it\u0027s synchronous yet had a flag that determines whether or not it\u0027s synchronous (although \u0027addFutureCallback\u0027 doesn\u0027t seem clear on that). That seems confusing to me. I would suggest either keep it as \u0027submitTransaction\u0027 and name the flag \u0027doAsync\u0027 or keep it as \u0027syncSubmitTransaction\u0027 but w/o the flag so it always does what the method name implies",
