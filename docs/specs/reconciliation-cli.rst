============================
Reconciliation CLI and Alarm
============================

This spec addresses following enhancement in Openflowplugin module:

Addition of user triggered reconciliation via karaf cli command or rpc in Openflowplugin.

Problem description
===================
Whenever there is a state (flow/group) mismatch between config inventory and Openflow switch, user has to either restart
the Openflow switch or odl controller. This will sync the state again between odl controller and Openflow switch.

Reconciliation
==============
User can trigger reconciliation to sync the state between controller and Openflow switch. It can be done either via
karaf cli command or rest rpc.

Reconciliation Alarm
====================
Reconciliation alarm will be generated whenever user trigger the reconciliation via cli command or rest rpc and the
same will be cleared once reconciliation is completed.

Use Cases
---------

a. Trigger reconciliation for a single Openflow switch
b. Trigger reconciliation for a list of Openflow switch
c. Trigger reconciliation for all the connected Openflow switches
d. Raise alarm whenever user triggers reconciliation for a Openflow switch
e. Clear the alarm when the reconciliation completed for a Openflow swtich

Proposed change
---------------
Karaf CLI command will be added to trigger reconciliation for the given Openflow nodes.
Rest rpc will be exposed to trigger reconciliation for the given Openflow nodes.

Feature `odl-openflowplugin-app-southbound-cli` should be installed in order to get these karaf cli and rest rpc.
This feature is not part of any existing openflowplugin features and has to be installed explicitly by user.

Ref: `Southbound CLI <https://docs.opendaylight.org/projects/openflowplugin/en/latest/specs/southbound-cli.html>`__

Below two CLIs will be added,

* openflow:reconcile
* openflow:getreconciliationcount

Targeted Release
----------------
Flourine

Alternatives
------------
Disconnect the device from controller and reconnect or restart the controller.

REST API
--------

* POST: http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/reconciliation:reconcile
* GET: http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/reconciliation:reconciliation-counter

Usage
=====
Install ``odl-openflowplugin-app-southbound-cli`` feature.

CLI:
----
Trigger reconciliation for a connected openflow node via cli command ``openflow:reconcile``.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: openflow:reconcile

   opendaylight-user@root>openflow:reconcile 244711506862915
   reconcile successfully completed for the nodes

Trigger reconciliation for all the connected openflow nodes via cli command ``openflow:reconcile -all``.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: openflow:reconcile -all

         opendaylight-user@root>openflow:reconcile -all
         reconcile successfully completed for the nodes

Get details about number of times user triggered reconciliation for openflow nodes via ``openflow:getreconciliationcount``.
