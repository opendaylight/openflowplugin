      "message": "Yes, but problem is probably also with using PORTDESC, because it will not work for OF 1.0 (atleast I do not found it anywhere in OF 1.0 spec, I found only port stats there) and OF 1.0 is anyway getting ports from FEATURES_REPLY. Also, with PORT_DESC approach, after looking at tests it seems that some links are missing, but I am not sure if it is related to missed port status messages, but after I ran test-openflowplugin-core on this patch with registry, tests was blue again, so it is highly possible.",
