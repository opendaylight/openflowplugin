      "message": "why do openflowplugin has to depend on genius ? I am not very comfortable about this dependency, because it can create circular dependency. Other question we need to answer here is, will user be able to use openflowplugin standalone, without loading the genuis feature in their karaf?",

But srm-api is an independent api, which do not depend on any of the genius core modules. Openflowplugin standalone can work by adding this, because genius-srm-api feature is added as part of odl-openflowplugin-app-forwardingrules-manager feature as dependent feature and that feature is independent of genius core apis.",
