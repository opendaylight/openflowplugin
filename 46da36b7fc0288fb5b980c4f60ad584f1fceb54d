      "message": "I would suggest to close the previous connection and use the new connection. There is a scenario, where plugin gets the second connection, but first connection still shows healthy in plugin although switch is disconnected. In this case, switch will never be able to connect to controller, because it will keep rejecting the new connection.",

(Plugin have to rely on OFJ events)\n\nIf we close the old connection we can run in circles. Closing old connection causes to rejoin the device and then plugin closes again the latest connection. Replacing will not help either.\n\nIf there is a new connection coming from the same device with another port than the old and running and correct connection plugin shouldn\u0027t be closed.",
