      "message": "i think you need to first figure out the intent of majority of application, by looking through all the existing registered services. Or probably you can do that when applications register for reconciliation notification. Also given that you will have to block till the reconciliation is done for that service, it\u0027s better to fail fast if the intent is to disconnect the device. If the intent is DO_NOTHING then you can carry on with the next service reconciliation. Also given that you are blocking here, you need need to use Futures.successfulAsList(List).get();",
