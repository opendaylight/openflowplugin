There are unit tests which explicitly test for multiple items with the same experimenter -- if this were stored to the datastore, it would result in those duplicates eliminated, i.e. there really could only ever be a one instruction for a particular experimenter.\n\nIt feels \u0027key\u0027 here should be eliminated, but I do need your confirmation.",
