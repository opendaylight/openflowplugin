      "message": "Arun, I need some domain help here:\n\nI am pretty sure this part with \u0027ordered-by\u0027 is correct, as the order of instructions needs to be retained.\n\nI am not sure whether the \u0027key experimenter-id\u0027 is correct. There are unit tests which explicitly test for multiple items with the same experimenter -- if this were stored to the datastore, it would result in those duplicates eliminated, i.e. there really could only ever be a one instruction for a particular experimenter.\n\nIt feels \u0027key\u0027 here should be eliminated, but I do need your confirmation.",
