      "message": "personally I would not add extends SystemReadyListener here, but instead only add implements SystemReadyListener to OpenFlowPluginProviderImpl, because this really is an implementation detail - an  openflowplugin-api consumer should not have to have a clue that its using infrautils.ready and infrautils.diagstatus inside.\n\nPS: In fact, even having the dependency in the POM seems wrong to me, but that may be more difficult to change? I noticed that OpenFlowPluginProviderFactory .. this seems curious to me, but fixing that is certainly out of scope for this otherwise simple change.",

      "message": "Had missed this comment. I tried to move this to OpenFlowpluginProviderImpl but ran into test failures. The testInitializeAndClose() in OpenFlowpluginProviderImplTest tests the start and shutdown(of switch connections). The start of the switch connections now being triggered on onSystemBootReady event, had to be manually called within the test method. The newInstance() method of OpenFlowPluginProviderFactory returns Openflowpluginprovider on which can call the onSystemBootReady(). So having the Openflowpluginprovider implement SystemReadyListener rather than OpenflowpluginproviderImpl.",
