      "message": "personally I would not add extends SystemReadyListener here, but instead only add implements SystemReadyListener to OpenFlowPluginProviderImpl, because this really is an implementation detail - an  openflowplugin-api consumer should not have to have a clue that its using infrautils.ready and infrautils.diagstatus inside.\n\nPS: In fact, even having the dependency in the POM seems wrong to me, but that may be more difficult to change? I noticed that OpenFlowPluginProviderFactory .. this seems curious to me, but fixing that is certainly out of scope for this otherwise simple change.",
