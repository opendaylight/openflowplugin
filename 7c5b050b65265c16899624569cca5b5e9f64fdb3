It seems you\u0027re defining the same setting in 2 different ways. Are both injected into code and, if so, which one wins?",

      "message": "The CSS xml files are still there but deprecated with the conversion to blueprint. They remain for backwards compatibility. But I\u0027m not referring to that. In openflowplugin.xml, it uses the clustered-app-config extension to retrieve the openflow-provider-config yang instance and injects it into the openflowPluginProvider. It also uses the cm:managed-properties to inject cfg properties. This was added sometime after I had converted it to blueprint. My question is why was the cfg added, especially since the properties are also in the openflow-provider-config yang. Now there\u0027s 2 ways for a user to change the properties and they can stomp on one another. The cfg file should be removed.",

To change it at runtime, you write to the data store, although after that the external XML file is no longer used.

      "message": "yes. But the fact that it ignores the initial xml file after changing in DS is no different to how the CSS works. In CSS, the XML file in etc/opendaylight/karaf is the initial module config, same as the external XML file for clustered-app-config. In CSS, if you push a change via restconf, the initial files in etc/opendaylight/karaf are moved to the current.xml which is used from then on. Again this behavior is the same as with clustered-app-config when written to the DS.",
