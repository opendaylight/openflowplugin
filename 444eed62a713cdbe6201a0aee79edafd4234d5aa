      "message": "FYI I\u0027m not 100% sure that this actually works... inheritance of annotations is a bit of a mess, AFAIK.  From what I remember, it\u0027s best to not annotate an abstract class at all, and put all annotations, incl. this @PreDestroy, only on (all of) the subclasses.",

      "message": "Actually, after a closer 2nd look, please ignore thie review feedback.. in this case, the subclasses do not @Override close() so you can\u0027t annotate.  This probably works.  What I remembered is the case if a subclass overrides the close and does not repeat the annotation, then it\u0027s not crystal clear what it should mean.  I guess the safest thing therefore would be to make this close() method here final - do you want to do that?",

      "message": "just for future clarity and to avoid confusion, would you terribly mind just completely removing this, instead of leaving it in commented out form?  If anyone needs to understand the history, there is always git to the rescue! ;) As far as I can tell, there is actually nothing left in this file now, so could you just completely delete this entire BP XML file as part of this change, instead of leaving it in but empty?  Like you have done elsewhere.",
