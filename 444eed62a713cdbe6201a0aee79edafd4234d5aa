      "message": "Actually, after a closer 2nd look, please ignore thie review feedback.. in this case, the subclasses do not @Override close() so you can\u0027t annotate.  This probably works.  What I remembered is the case if a subclass overrides the close and does not repeat the annotation, then it\u0027s not crystal clear what it should mean.  I guess the safest thing therefore would be to make this close() method here final - do you want to do that?",

If anyone needs to understand the history, there is always git to the rescue! ;) As far as I can tell, there is actually nothing left in this file now, so could you just completely delete this entire BP XML file as part of this change, instead of leaving it in but empty?
