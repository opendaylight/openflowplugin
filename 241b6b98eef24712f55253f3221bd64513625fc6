      "message": "I strongly believe this shall be limited in order to prevent DOS attack. \nThe only reason for having this pool is to provide simultaneous hello message (to and from device). And that message has to be delivered into netty\u0027s pipeline by a non-netty thread. So for every incoming connection there is just one task. There is one thread and 20 task slots. The thing is that if we are too slow then device will send the first hello and this pool will then be skipped for that connection.\n\nOn the other hand if we have 20 tasks pending then next connection will be actively closed. But it also means that controller is under heavy load and it makes no sense to accept another device. In my opinion - as soon as we have stress tests proving that this limit causes connection flaps and system is not overloaded than it is time to pull this constant to parameter.",

      "message": "Thank you. Actually devices won\u0027t get disconnected upon queue full but just controller will fail to send to first hello. It will simply wait for hello from device and the queue full exception will be dropped.\n\nThis can be considered as specification violation. I guess that the best way to go is to start logging exception thrown by pool.submit in ConnectionReadyListenerImpl.onConnectionReady(). Then we will know if the limit is wrong.",
