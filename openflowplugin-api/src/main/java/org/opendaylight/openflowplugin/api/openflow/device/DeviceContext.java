/**
 * <p>
 * The central entity of OFP is the Device Context, which encapsulate the logical state of a switch
 * as seen by the controller. Each OpenFlow session is tracked by a Connection Context.
 * These attach to a particular Device Context in such a way, that there is at most one primary
 * session associated with a Device Context. Whenever the controller needs to interact with a
 * particular switch, it will do so in the context of the calling thread, obtaining a lock on
 * the corresponding Device Context â€“ thus the Device Context becomes the fine-grained point
 * of synchronization. The only two entities allowed to send requests towards the switch are
 * Statistics Manager and RPC Manager. Each of them allocates a Request Context for interacting
 * with a particular Device Context. The Request Contexts are the basic units of fairness,
 * which is enforced by keeping a cap on the number of outstanding requests a particular Request
 * Context can have at any point in time. Should this quota be exceeded, any further attempt to make
 * a request to the switch will fail immediately, with proper error indication.
 * </p>
