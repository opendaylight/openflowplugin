<body>
    Generic service for asynchronous event dispatch. Components that have
    listeners can implement an {@link org.opendaylight.util.event.EventSink event sink},
    register it with the {@link org.opendaylight.util.event.EventSinkBroker sink broker}
    and then simply post {@link org.opendaylight.util.event.Event events} and forget
    about them.
    <p>
    The {@link org.opendaylight.util.event.AbstractEventSink} serves as a convenient base
    for implementing an event sink.
