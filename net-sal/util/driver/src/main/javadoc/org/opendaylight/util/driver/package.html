Specifications for various aspects device modeling and device driver 
development.  
These specifications revolve around separation of concerns among the following 
areas exposed to the <em>consumers</em> of the device driver implementations
<ul>
<li>device information representation ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceInfo} &amp; {@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.Facet})
<li>device interactions, i.e. communication &amp; control  ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceHandler})
<li>device information persistence  ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceLoader})
<li>device type-based brokering &amp; evolution ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceDriverProvider} &amp; {@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceDriverFactory})
</ul>

Additionally, the following areas of support are available for the
<em>providers</em> of the device driver implementations for various
<em>types</em> of devices. 
<ul>
<li>device type-specific information interpretation ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceType} &amp; {@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.Facet})
<li>device type-based registration, brokering &amp; evolution ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceDriverBroker} &amp; {@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.DeviceDriverFactory})
<li>facet-based device information &amp; behaviour presentation ({@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.Facet} &amp; {@link org.opendaylight.util.driver.FacetProvider})
<li>number of abstract and default implementations suitable for extension, to ease authoring of device driver implementations
</ul>
