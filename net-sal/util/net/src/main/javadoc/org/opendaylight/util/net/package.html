A set of classes representing data values in the network management domain.
<p>
    These classes have been carefully crafted to provide the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>
        Type-safety in API definitions
    </li>
    <li>
        Instances are immutable (and thus inherently threadsafe)
    </li>
    <li>
        Instances are <i>Serializable</i> so can be passed from VM to VM
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> have been overridden
        to ensure instances play nicely with the <i>Collection</i> framework
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>Comparable</code> interface has been implemented to provide
        an "intuitive" sort order
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>valueOf()</code> static methods allow for creation of instances
        from a variety of "external" representations
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>to<i>Type</i>()</code> instance methods convert back
        to "external" representations
    </li>
    <li>
        Convenience instance methods, such as
        <code>mac.getEthernetCompany() : String</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Convenience static methods, such as
        <code>SubnetMask.fromCidr(String) : SubnetMask</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Convenience static fields, such as
        <code>IpAddress.LOOPBACK_IPv4</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Under-the-covers memory footprint optimizations
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following schematic illustrates the relationship between the classes
<code>IpAddress</code>, <code>IpRange</code>, <code>SubnetMask</code>,
<code>Subnet</code>, and <code>PartialSubnet</code>:
