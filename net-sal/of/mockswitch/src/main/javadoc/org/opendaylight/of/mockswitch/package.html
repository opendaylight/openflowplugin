Provides mock implementations of OpenFlow switches.

<p>
    The following schematic illustrates the relationship of classes that are
    used in composing a mock switch.

    The <code>MockOpenflowSwitch</code> uses a <code>SwitchDefn</code> which,
    in turn, uses a <code>SwitchDefReader</code> to parse a text-based
    definition file that describes the characteristics of the mock-switch.
