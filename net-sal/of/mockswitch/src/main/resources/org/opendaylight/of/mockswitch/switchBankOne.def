#### Switch Bank ONE - A bank of Mock OpenFlow Switches

### Define the switches that make up the bank.
# Note the form "LNAME = filename.def" where LNAME is the logical name
# used in the scenario section, and filename.def is assumed to be a switch
# definition file in the same directory as this file.

[switches]
SW10 = simple10sw4port.def
SW13 = simple13sw32port.def

## TODO add packets section to parser
# [packets]
# define packets here that might be sent with Packet-IN messages
# LLDP_A = lldpPacketA.hex
# LLDP_B = lldpPacketB.hex

### Define the run-time scenario, invoked when the bank is activated.
[scenario]
# start with a pause
delay 1s

# fire up the two switches
activate SW10
delay 200ms
activate SW13

## TODO implement packet-in
# send a Packet-In from SW10
# delay 10ms
# packetIn SW10 LLDP_A

# wait a while before...
delay 4s

# shutting down the switches
deactivate SW13
delay 10ms
deactivate SW10
