#### Switch Bank :: Port State Tracker Scenario test
# A bank of one single Mock OpenFlow Switch (1.0)

### Define the switches that make up the bank.
# Note the form "LNAME = filename.def" where LNAME is the logical name
# used in the scenario section, and filename.def is assumed to be a switch
# definition file in the same directory as this file.
[switches]
SW10 = simple10sw4port.def

### Define the run-time scenario, invoked when the bank is activated.
[scenario]
# fire up a switch, wait for successful handshake, then wait for the test
activate SW10
helloSuccess SW10

# tell the controller that our port #4 is now down
portStatus SW10 p4 down

# tell the controller that our port #2 is now up
