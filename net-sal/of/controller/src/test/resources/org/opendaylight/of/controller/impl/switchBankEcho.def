#### Switch Bank ECHO - A single switch that emits an echo-request

### Define the switches that make up the bank.
# Note the form "LNAME = filename.def" where LNAME is the logical name
# used in the scenario section, and filename.def is assumed to be a switch
# definition file in the same directory as this file.

# note: we need to activate both SW10 and SW13 for the unit test setup
#       assertions to hold true

[switches]
SW10 = simple10sw4port.def
SW13 = simple13sw32port.def

[scenario]
activate SW10
activate SW13
