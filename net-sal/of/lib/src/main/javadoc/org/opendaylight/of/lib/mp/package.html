Representations of OpenFlow Protocol Multipart Message bodies.
<p>
The following schematic illustrates the relationship of classes and
interfaces that make up a <code>OfmMultipartRequest</code> or
<code>OfmMultipartReply</code>. Note that two examples of concrete classes
are given:
<ul>
    <li>
        On the left, <code>MBodyDesc</code>: representing the
        multipart body of a <code>MultipartType.DESC</code> reply,
        along with its mutable subclass.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the right, <code>MBodyPortDesc</code>: representing a single
        element of a <code>MultipartType.PORT_DESC</code> reply, along with
        its inner classes <code>Array</code> (immutable) and
        <code>Mutable Array</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
