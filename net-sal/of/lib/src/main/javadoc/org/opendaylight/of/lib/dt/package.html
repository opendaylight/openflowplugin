A set of classes representing data values used in the OpenFlow protocol.
<p>
    These classes are based on the "Cacheable Data Type" design and provide
    the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>
        Type-safety in API definitions
    </li>
    <li>
        Instances are immutable (and thus inherently threadsafe)
    </li>
    <li>
        Instances are <i>Serializable</i> so can be passed from VM to VM
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> have been overridden
        to ensure instances play nicely with the <i>Collection</i> framework
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>Comparable</code> interface has been implemented to provide
        an "intuitive" sort order
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>valueOf()</code> static methods allow for creation of instances
        from a variety of "external" representations
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>to<i>Type</i>()</code> instance methods convert
        back to "external" representations
    </li>
    <li>
        Under-the-covers memory footprint optimizations
    </li>
</ul>
