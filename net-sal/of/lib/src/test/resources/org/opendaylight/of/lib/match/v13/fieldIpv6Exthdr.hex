# An example match field TLV
# See section A.2.3.2 Flow Match Field Structures of the 1.3 Spec.
#
# Basic :: IPV6_EXTHDR (no mask)

# Class (u16) : Basic = 0x8000
80 00

# Field + hasMask Bit (u8) : IPV6_EXTHDR(39<<1) (no mask) = 0x4e
4e

# Length of payload excluding header (u8) = 2
02

## Payload
# Random sampling of flags:
# NO_NEXT (  0x1)
# AUTH    (  0x4)
# ROUTER  ( 0x20)
# UN_SEQ  (0x100)
01 25

### Note this value/(no-mask) combination equates to:
#
#   NO_NEXT = must be PRESENT
#   ESP     = must be ABSENT
#   AUTH    = must be PRESENT
#   DEST    = must be ABSENT
#   FRAG    = must be ABSENT
#   ROUTER  = must be PRESENT
#   HOP     = must be ABSENT
#   UN_REP  = must be ABSENT
#   UN_SEQ  = must be PRESENT
