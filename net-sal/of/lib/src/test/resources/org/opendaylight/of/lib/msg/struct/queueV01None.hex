# An example queue structure for OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1.
# See ofp_packet_queue
#
## This particular queue descriptor has a NONE property

## NONE - is dropped in 1.2+
## Not sure whether this is a valid structure as is.

# queue id (u32) = 14
00 00 00 0e

# queue descriptor length (u16) = 16
00 10

# padding (u8 x 2) : 64-bit alignment
00 00

#### Now the List of Properties follows
## First Property

# property (u16) = NONE (0)
00 00

# property length (u16) = 8
00 08

# padding (u8 x 4) : 64-bit alignment
00 00 00 00
