# An example match field TLV
# See section A.2.3.2 Flow Match Field Structures of the 1.3 Spec.

# Basic :: IPV6_EXTHDR (with mask)

# Class (u16) : Basic = 0x8000
80 00

# Field + hasMask Bit (u8) : IPV6_EXTHDR(39<<1) (with mask) = 0x4f
4f

# Length of payload excluding header (u8) = 4
04

## Payload
# Random sampling of flags:
# AUTH    (  0x4)
# ROUTER  ( 0x20)
00 24

# Mask
# AUTH    (  0x4)
# FRAG    ( 0x10)
# ROUTER  ( 0x20)
# HOP     ( 0x40)
00 74

### Note this value/mask combination equates to:
#
#   NO_NEXT = don't care
#   ESP     = don't care
#   AUTH    = must be PRESENT
#   DEST    = don't care
#   FRAG    = must be ABSENT
#   ROUTER  = must be PRESENT
#   HOP     = must be ABSENT
#   UN_REP  = don't care
#   UN_SEQ  = don't care
