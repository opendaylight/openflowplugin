# An example hello element structure (1.3)
# This one is VERSION_BITMAP, supporting 1.1 and 1.3

# hello element type (u16) = 1 (VERSION_BITMAP)
00 01

# length in bytes of this element (u16) = 8
00 08

# First bitmap (versions 0 to 31)
# V_1_1 : 1 << 0x02  = 0x04
# V_1_3 : 1 << 0x04  = 0x10
00 00 00 14


## Zero-Filled Padding to bring total structure length to multiple of 8
## element struct length is 8; add 0 to bring it to 8
