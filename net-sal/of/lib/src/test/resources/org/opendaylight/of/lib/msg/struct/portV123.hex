## current and maximum speed fields indicate the current and maximum bit
## rate (raw transmission speed) of the link in kbps. The number should be
## rounded to match common usage. For example, an optical 10 Gb Ethernet
## port should have this field set to 10000000 (instead of 10312500), and
## an OC-192 port should have this field set to 10000000 (instead of 9953280).
##
## The max speed indicates the maximum configured capacity of the link, whereas
## the current speed indicates the current capacity. If the port is a LAG with
## 3 links of 1Gb/s capacity, with one of the ports of the LAG being down,
## one port auto-negotiated at 1Gb/s and 1 port auto-negotiated at 100Mb/s, the
## max speed is 3 Gb/s and the current speed is 1.1 Gb/s.

# current speed (u32) = 1100000 (1.1 Gb/s)

# maximum speed (u32) = 3000000 (3.0 Gb/s)
