# Example match structure
# See section A.2.3 Flow Match Structures of the 1.3 Spec.

# Match field pre-requisite test
# VLAN_VID requires none
# Validation should SUCCEED

## Match Header
# Type (u16) = OXM (0x1)
00 01
# Length (u16) = 10 (excludes padding)
00 0a

## Match Field
# Basic, VLAN_VID(6<<1),   len
  8000   0c                02
# PRESENT (0x1000) | VLAN ID (0x234)
  1234

## Zero-Filled Padding to bring total structure
##   length to multiple of 8.
## Match struct length is 10; add 6 = 16
